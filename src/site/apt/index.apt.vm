yal10n Maven Plugin

  The Yet Another Localization Maven Plugin helps in the localization process of software projects.

* Goals Overview

  This plugin has 2 goals:

  * {{{./dashboard-mojo.html}yal10n:dashboard}} Creates a dashboard overview.

  * {{{./detect-changes-mojo.html}yal10n:detect-changes}} Detects changes to resource bundles and sends notification
  emails.


* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Yal10n Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}.


* Bug reports / Feature requests

  Please report any bugs or feature requests at {{http://sourceforge.net/p/yal10n/tickets}}.

* Future ideas, missing features

  * localize the dashboard itself

  * better documentation (available checks, configuration, ...)

  * report / detect changes based on the revision of the files or even with annotate/blame, line-based check

  * add a report mojo, to make it easy to include the report of a single project into a site
  
  * make the checks available as a project mojo, so you can fail the build, if something is wrong with the resource
    bundles.

  * pseudo language generation

  * support other scms than subversion and git (e.g. mercurial)

  * more configuration options for TMX

  * support other resources than message bundles (like templates), that need to be localized, too.
